                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong)
                        Indian</b>
                    scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear
                    weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.
                    Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
                    In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the
                    SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining
                    DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped
                    earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first
                    intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in
                    1989.

                <h3>Biography of A.P.J Kalam</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president,
                        Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a
                        20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India.
                    </li>

                    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in
                        aeronautical engineering in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and
                        Development Organisation (DRDO)—an Indian military research institute—and later the Indian Space
                        Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam’s associations were not limited to research organizations:
                        he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
                    </li>

                    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to
                        develop India’s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase
                        the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam’s services to the country
                        and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.
                    </li>

                    <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international
                        community. His most notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna,
                        won in 1997, for his contributions to science and engineering and service to the government.
